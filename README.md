# Heart-Failure-Prediction-model


We first explored the data to get a hinge of the data. We then performed Univariate and Bivariate analyses, as well as data visualization were performed on the target and features variables.

To ensure that this forecast is as accurate as possible, we also performed a full feature engineering which includes all of the necessary valid processes for the model engineering.

Based on the aforementioned model accuracy, Random Forest provided 90% accuracy. Demonstrating that it is the most appropriate model for the prediction.
